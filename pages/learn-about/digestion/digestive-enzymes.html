<p class="p1"><span class="s1">No matter how healthy your diet, without enough of the <b>correct digestive enzymes in your system</b>, your body can not properly break down the nutrients from the food to utilize them. The majority of our digestive enzymes are produced by the <b>pancreas</b>. Some are produced by the <b>salivary glands and stomach</b>, as well. In order for the body to absorb nutrients from the food, specific enzymes must be present. <b>Fats are broken down into fatty acids and cholesterol, carbohydrates into simple sugars, protein into amino acids.</b> Then there are other compounds, vitamins, and minerals that must be in a usable form, as well. <b>Undigested food can seep from the gut back into the blood stream causing immune system reactions, food allergies/intolerances</b>, and may be related to <b>weight gain, digestive discomforts, ADHD, joint problems, sleep problems, trouble getting up in the morning, hives, depression, mood swings, cravings and many more issues.</b> Sluggish digestion also <b>speeds up the aging process.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>So, how do you know if you are deficient in digestive enzymes? </b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It is best to act as a detective on your case.After a meal, if the <b>food sits in your stomach feeling like a rock</b>, or you have <b>gas and bloating</b>, you may be enzyme deficient.This is a fun one: check your stool.If you have oily stool, especially after eating a high fat meal, you might have an enzyme deficiency.If you see undigested food, you might have an enzyme deficiency. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We know that we live in a fast-paced, stressful world. <b>Chronic stress</b> can play a factor in production of digestive enzymes, as can <b>pancreatic disorders, food allergies, gut health, low stomach acid and general inflammation</b>.If you have never been tested for food allergies, you can start by embarking on a <b>30 day, elimination diet</b>, removing the foods that are known to be common allergens or toxins: dairy, soy, wheat, caffeine, alcohol, sugar, corn, pork. After 4 weeks, slowly add back each one you wish to consume again every three days. You should be able to notice digestive, skin, or energy level signs if the food is a problem for you.Of course, we also offer <b>food sensitivity testing and solutions in our clinic</b>. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Along with removing allergens and toxins, eating <b>plenty of vegetables</b> will help bring your body to a <b>proper pH level</b>, which aids in <b>reduction of inflammation</b>.<b>Raw fruits and vegetables contain their own necessary enzymes to aid in digesting them</b>. <b>Legumes and grains can act as enzyme inhibitors</b>, and might be best eaten infrequently while trying to balance digestion. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once you have pinpointed which foods your body is having trouble digesting properly, you might also wish to<b> supplement with digestive enzymes</b>. I recommend taking a <b>high quality, broad spectrum, plant-based supplement no more than 10 minutes before each meal.</b> Choose a brand that lists potency.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here is a list of some enzymes and what they digest:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Lipase</b>-fats found in oils, nuts and dairy</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Amylase</b>-starches</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Cellulase</b>-fruit, grain, vegetable and seed fiber</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Lactase</b>-lactose (milk sugar)</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Invertase</b>-sucrose (sugar)</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Malt Diastase</b>-carbohydrates</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Protease</b>-protein</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Peptidase</b>-casein and gluten</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Glucoamylase</b>-maltose (the sugar found in grains)</span>
<span class="s1"><b>Alpha Galactosidase</b>-carbohydrates in legumes which cause gas</span></p>
