Reiki is a common and often utilized healing modality. It is a Japanese technique which creates a deep state of centered relaxation while increasing mental clarity.

Reiki activates the natural healing process at the cellular level to balance the body’s internal flow of energy. Reiki helps release blockages in the body to re-energize and normalize body systems. Reiki can be used for physical or emotional issues, whether it is acute or chronic. Also, by incorporating muscle testing, we can determine the area of imbalance and prioritize the body’s immediate need. Because Reiki produces renewal and well-being, it can also result in healthier choices and the release of negative patterns.
